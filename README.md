# AllBucks
## A school project, a mock site for a coffee shop (inspired by a real life counterpart) created with React and TypeScript.

## General Information
This project simulates a coffee shop wherein a customer can choose his seat and order off a menu, after which a on-hand barista will prepare the requested meal/drink and close the tab.

## Technologies:
* React, NodeJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS.

## Launch: 
If you haven't installed the dependencies yet, I recommend running "npm install" in a cmd under the project path.
Afterwards, navigate the cmd to the 'client' directory and run the command 'npm run dev' within it,
 if all is configured properly a site (localhost) should be opened on your default browser

## Project status: 
No longer being worked on. This was my first hands-on experience with TypeScript and React as a whole.
I have since revised my methods, corrected and improved them, and applied them to some of my other projects.

## Acknowledgements
This was part of my intro to computer networking course, and as such I must thank my lecturer Ms. Alona Kutsyy.
